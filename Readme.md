# Deathroll Companion

TODO: Update readme!

## Features



## Installation

This addon is officially available from [its Wago Addons page](https://addons.wago.io/addons/deathrollcompanion), as well as through [GitHub releases](https://github.com/JP1998/DeathrollCompanion/releases). Furthermore you can download the source code directly from [the GitHub repository](https://github.com/JP1998/DeathrollCompanion).

I've chosen these platforms because they are the ones I personally use, and at this time I don't see a reason to create releases for other platforms, as there is no demand. Nonetheless, I understand some people also use WowInterface or CurseForge, so if you'd like me to create releases on any other addon platform please [create an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/JP1998/DeathrollCompanion/issues/new) and I'll look into it.

## Planned features and improvements
